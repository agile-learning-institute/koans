Cool [koans](https://github.com/orgs/agile-learning-institute/repositories?q=koan&type=all) to learn stuff

## Before Contributing

Since GitHub does not have the concepts of folders to organize repositories, we are using a naming convention to make it easy to find related code. All Koans repositories should be created in the agile-learning-institute organization. The repositories should follow this convention ```koan-[language]-[testing]-[topic]``` as in ```koan-ts-jest-mongodb``` which is a Typscript Koan that uses the Jest unit testing framework, to learn MongoDB.
